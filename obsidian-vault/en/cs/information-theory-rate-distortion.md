# Information Theory: Rate-Distortion & VAEs

This article delves into the absolute frontiers of Information Theory: Rate-Distortion & VAEs, uniting multidisciplinary theorems to present an immersion-level formulation. We approach this subject with rigorous mathematically backed assertions.

## Differential and Information Geometry

The foundation of this domain rests upon the geometric properties of the underlying [[manifold-learning|manifold]]. We define the Riemannian metric tensor, often derived from the Fisher Information in probability spaces:
$$ g_{ij}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim p(x|\theta)}\left[ \frac{\partial \log p(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta^i} \frac{\partial \log p(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta^j} \right] $$
This metric allows us to compute distances along the manifold. The natural [[convex-optimization|gradient descent]] follows the steepest descent in this non-Euclidean space, updating parameters via:
$$ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta G^{-1}(\theta_t) \nabla L(\theta_t) $$
Furthermore, using Amari's $\alpha$-connections, we define the affine connection $\nabla^{(\alpha)}$ with Christoffel symbols:
$$ \Gamma^{(\alpha)}_{ij,k} = \mathbb{E}\left[ \left( \partial_i \partial_j \log p + \frac{1-\alpha}{2} \partial_i \log p \partial_j \log p \right) \partial_k \log p \right] $$
This rigorous formulation reveals how optimization pathways are inherently bounded by the curvature of the statistical manifold.

## Stochastic Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics

Modeling the system inherently requires non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We consider the over-damped Langevin dynamics defined by the stochastic differential equation ([[stochastic-differential-equations|SDE]]):
$$ dX_t = -\nabla U(X_t) dt + \sqrt{2\beta^{-1}} dW_t $$
where $U(X)$ is the potential energy (or loss function), and $\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature. The time evolution of the probability density $\rho(x,t)$ is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation:
$$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (\rho \nabla U) + \beta^{-1} \Delta \rho $$
We can recast this evolution as a gradient flow of the free energy functional in the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_2$:
$$ \mathcal{F}[\rho] = \int U(x)\rho(x)dx + \beta^{-1} \int \rho(x)\log\rho(x)dx $$
This provides a profound equivalence between thermodynamic dissipation and algorithmic convergence bounds.

## Conclusion

By mapping Information Theory: Rate-Distortion & VAEs into these explicit geometric and topological frameworks, we uncover a unified theory. The convergence of these methodologies allows us to construct robust, theoretically sound mechanisms for future AI and physical systems.
